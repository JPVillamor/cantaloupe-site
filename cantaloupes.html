		<h3>About Us</h3> <!--the HASHTAG's a link to to a Wikipedia article on jokes-->
		<p>WE are a national organization dedicated to achieving the ultimate goal of eradicating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joke">#AllCantaloupes</a>. Our society was created in 2017 with the inception of this very webpage. Our group is the long awaited answer to the call for justice against the very embodiment of tyrannical oppression: the fruit known as the cantaloupe.</p>

In the early days of the ACSA, its constituents referred to themselves as "Canta-Nopes". As you can see, this was a clever play on the word "cantaloupes"; thus, following the same logic, a singular one of these would be referred to as a "Canta-Nope".</p>
		<h3>Why We Believe What We Believe and Why We Believe That You Should Also Believe What We Believe</h3>
		<p>It actually is quite simple. There are three distinct features of every cantaloupe that are at the center of this grand conspiracy:</p>
